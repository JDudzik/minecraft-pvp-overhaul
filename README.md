# Minecraft PVP Overhaul

This mod is an entire overhaul of the Minecraft Bedrock PVP system in order to bring more engaging world combat to the server.
Be warned: This pack has not been updated along-side MC Bedrock, and thus, will certainly be broken as it requires a modded server client in order enable scripts and other experimental features. This mod also requires the server you're running to have very specific custom entities to enable some custom logic.

This mod also comes equipped with a full suite of admin tools, persistent storage, better K/D tracking, custom PVP-enhancing items, etc. This mod will be best used as a reference or educational source for your own creations!

Have fun!
